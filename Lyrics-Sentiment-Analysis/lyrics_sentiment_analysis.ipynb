    "# Insights from Comparing the Two Sentiment Analysis Methods:\n",
    "**Sentiment Range**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TextBlob (get_sentiment): The sentiment scores are in the range from -1 (negative) to +1 (positive), with scores generally close to 0 for more neutral tones (e.g., songs like \"A.06\" by Linkin Park and \"100 GB (Un-Official)\" by Drake, which have a score of 0.0).\n",
    "- VADER (get_vader_sentiment): The VADER scores also range from -1 to +1, but the results show a wider spread. For example, VADER assigns high positive sentiment to songs like \"2step\" by Ed Sheeran with a score of 0.9945, but also gives negative scores like -0.9871 for \"6 Inch Heel\" by The Weeknd.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sensitivity to Song Lyrics**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- TextBlob seems to provide more moderate sentiment scores, likely due to its simpler method of analysis. It often provides near-neutral scores (around 0), even for songs with relatively emotional content.\n",
    "- VADER appears to be more sensitive to emotion in lyrics. It detects strong positive or negative sentiment more distinctly. For instance, \"2step (American Remix)\" by Ed Sheeran has a score of 0.9955 in VADER, indicating a strongly positive tone, whereas TextBlob assigns it only a modest 0.1206.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Contrast in Song Sentiment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Songs that both methods identify as positive include \"2step\" by Ed Sheeran, where VADER gives a very high score (0.9945) compared to TextBlob’s 0.1206. This could indicate that VADER is better at picking up on enthusiastic or positive sentiment in songs with energetic or upbeat tones.\n",
    "- On the other hand, songs like \"6 Inch Heel\" by The Weeknd show a stark contrast: VADER assigns a strongly negative sentiment score (-0.9871), while TextBlob gives a mild negative score (-0.1962). This could be because VADER is more sensitive to intense negative emotion in the lyrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Neutral Sentiment**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Both methods agree on neutral or almost neutral sentiment for songs like \"A.06\" by Linkin Park, which gets a score of 0.0 from both methods. This suggests that these methods are aligned when the sentiment is subtle or unclear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genre and Artist Influence**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The differences in sentiment analysis scores might reflect the artists' emotional range or the lyrical content typical of their genre. For example, Drake's songs like \"0 to 100 / The Catch Up\" are strongly negative in VADER (-0.9987), which might be due to the intense, raw emotion often found in his lyrics. TextBlob still shows negative sentiment for these songs but to a lesser degree.\n",
    "# Conclusion:\n",
    "- **VADER** is generally more sensitive to extreme positive and negative emotions, making it suitable for analyzing songs with clear emotional extremes.\n",
    "- **TextBlob** provides more moderate sentiment scores, making it more suitable for capturing nuanced or subtle feelings."
